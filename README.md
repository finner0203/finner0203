Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Finn Tran** and I'm an undergraduate student @UofT for a **Double Major in Economics & Statistical Science with a minor in Computer Science**. I have a strong passion for anything Analytical related, with particular interest in leveraging Machine Learning to explore data-driven insights, optimize decision-making, and solve complex problems. Through CourseA training certificates, I intend to expand on my knowledge and apply it into self-learning projects and work settings.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying Regression Analysis and Statistical Learning

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning methods for Machine Learning 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects related to anything above

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Statistical analysis and financial modelling 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: finn.tran@mail.utoronto.ca

âš¡ Fun fact: I love everything athletics-related, particularly a huge fan of MMA

My programming skills mostly compromise of the PyData stack (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SQLite), Excel VBA, R, with Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly or Tableau for data visualization.
