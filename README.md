My name is **Finn Tran** and I'm an undergraduate student @UofT for a **Double Major in Economics & Statistical Science with a minor in Mathematics**. I have a strong passion for anything Analytical related, with particular interest in leveraging Machine Learning to explore data-driven insights, optimize decision-making, and solve complex problems. Through CourseA training certificates, I intend to expand on my knowledge and apply it into self-learning projects and work settings.

My programming skills mostly compromise of the PyData stack (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, TensorFlow) and Seaborn, Matplotlib, or Plotly for data visualization. Feel free to reach out to me at: finn.tran@mail.utoronto.ca
